Both a Hubkit, and an Area can be given a MapUrl.
All areas are bound to their Hubkit by defualt, but if desired, an Area can be moved to its own specific Map.

Furthermore, Multiple Hubkits may be bound together in a HubkitArray, where each area in all hubkits can be bound to the same map. This permits maximum flexibility for how a Gravio user wishes to use their hubkits.
